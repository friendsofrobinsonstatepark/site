(WWLP) &#8211; Pioneer Valley Red Cross Hometown Heroes are chosen for having saved lives and helped improve the lives of others, while displaying strength of character. 22News shows you how two Agawam High School students sacrificed winning a race, when they helped someone on the opposing team who had suffered a seizure during the race.</p><p>&#8220;He had suffered a seizure, he was flushed, he was sweating, it didn&#8217;t look good,&#8221; said Sandra Land.</p><p>Hometown Heroes Sandra Land and Gina Lopez knew that by stopping to help the fallen cross country athlete from Belchertown High School, Agawam High School would forfeit the track meet at Robinson State Park last fall. They did the right thing.</p><p>&#8220;Gina going and getting help leading the people back to where I was with him, It seems that we lost the race in the end in the moment the face doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said Land.</p><p>&#8220;I learned that anyone can rise to the occasion. You don&#8217;t have to be a doctor, you can check someone in the smallest way, by checking to see If they&#8217;re okay,&#8221; said Lopez.</p><p>Gina Lopez and Sandra Land made a decision that endeared them to Agawam Mayor Richard Cohen who nominated them as Hometown Heroes and to their proud coaches Bill Dillon and Carla Warner.</p><p>&#8220;Oh extremely, these two girls really stepped up at the right time, they did the right thing,&#8221; said Coach Dillon.</p><p>&#8220;In giving up her potential win against Belchertown, she gave back to a young man&#8217;s health and the integrity of her team,&#8221; said Carla Warner.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="banner footer"><div><span class="link-box"><a href="/">Home</a></span><span class="link-box"><a href="/maps.html">Maps</a></span><span class="link-box"><a href="/events.html">Events</a></span><span class="link-box"><a href="/news.html">News</a></span><span class="link-box"><a href="/about.html">About</a></span></div><div><a href="http://github.com/friendsofrobinsonstatepark"><i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;Contribute</a></div></div></body></html>
